            Automobili Lamborghini is an Italian luxury supercar manufacturer founded in 1963
            in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy. The brand was born out of engineering pride and a
            refusal to accept mediocrity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lamborghini reshaped the automotive world with legendary models like the Miura and
            Countach, introducing radical design, mid-engine layouts, and emotional performance
            that defined the modern supercar.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, Lamborghini blends Italian drama with modern engineering, creating cars that
            are loud, aggressive, and unapologetically bold in both design and performance.
